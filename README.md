# API Development and Documentation Final Project

## Trivia App

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game. The game will be comprised of six category with each category having some questions, answers and difficulty displayed on cards. All backend code follows PEP8 style guidelines

### Prerequisites And Installation

# Setting up the Backend

### Install Dependencies

1. **Python 3.7** - Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

2. **Virtual Environment** - We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

3. **PIP Dependencies** - Once your virtual environment is setup and running, install the required dependencies by navigating to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Key Pip Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use to handle the lightweight SQL database. You'll primarily work in `app.py`and can reference `models.py`.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross-origin requests from our frontend server.

### Set up the Database

With Postgres running, create a `trivia` database:

```bash
createdb trivia
```

Populate the database using the `trivia.psql` file provided. From the `backend` folder in terminal run:

```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

### Run the Server

From within the `./src` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
flask run --reload
```

The `--reload` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

## Testing

Write at least one test for the success and at least one error behavior of each endpoint using the unittest library.

To deploy the tests, run

```bash
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```

### Setting Up The Frontend

### Installing Dependencies

1. **Installing Node and NPM**
   This project depends on Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before continuing, you must download and install Node (the download includes NPM) from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. **Installing project dependencies**
   This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the `frontend` directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```

> _tip_: `npm i`is shorthand for `npm install``

## Required Tasks

### Running Your Frontend in Dev Mode

The frontend app was built using create-react-app. In order to run the app in development mode use `npm start`. You can change the script in the `package.json` file.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

```bash
npm start
```

### Request Formatting

The frontend should be fairly straightforward and disgestible. You'll primarily work within the `components` folder in order to understand, and if you so choose edit, the endpoints utilized by the components. While working on your backend request handling and response formatting, you can reference the frontend to view how it parses the responses.

After you complete your endpoints, ensure you return to the frontend to confirm your API handles requests and responses appropriately:

- Endpoints defined as expected by the frontend
- Response body provided as expected by the frontend

### Optional: Updating Endpoints and API behavior

Would you rather the API had different behavior - different endpoints, return the response body in a different format? Go for it! Make the updates to your API and the corresponding updates to the frontend so it works with your API seamlessly.

### Optional: Styling

In addition, you may want to customize and style the frontend by editing the CSS in the `stylesheets` folder.

### API Reference

## Getting Started

-Base URL: At present the app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, <http://127.0.0.1:5000/>, which is set as proxy in the front end configuration.
-Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys.

Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objectsin the following format:

{
   "success": False,
   "error": 400,
   "message": "bad_request"
}

The API will return four error types when requests fail:

-400:Bad Request
-404:Resource Not Found
-405:Method Not Allowed
-422:Not Processable

## Endpoints
